## ðŸ“Š Dashboard for Main KPIs  
During my experience in CRM within the iGaming industry, I built several dashboards to monitor **key metrics**.  

They help to:  
âœ… Provide **real-time visibility** on business performance  
âœ… Detect **trends and anomalies** quickly  
âœ… Align stakeholders around a **single source of truth**

Hereâ€™s one I personally found extremely useful on a daily basis, 'cause it helps to visualize and filter trends and main differences according to the selected iGaming license and Country that we want to check:

âœ… Monitor **progress vs. targets** at a glance  
âœ… Keep teams **motivated and accountable**  
âœ… Support **strategic planning** with clear insights  

Find here an example of them, extremely useful when tracking our journey in reaching the markked goals:
